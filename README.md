# planthealthcnn
A CNN that uses transfer learning on mobilenet to decide if an image of a plant contains a healthy plant or a dying plant. This is esentially my [catdogcnn](https://github.com/qwertpi/catvdogcnn) code modified to work on 224x224 images of healthy and dying plants. I sourced my training images using the chrome extension fatkun batch image download and google images.

WARNING ONLY LINUX IS OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED

Feedback and pull requests are very welcome

# Usage
## Data augmentation (optional)
0\. Download this repo `git clone https://github.com/qwertpi/planthealthcnn.git`  
1\. Source some images of healthy and dying plants and put them in the respective folders in images  
2\. Resize your images `cd images/healthy/ && for file in *; do convert $file -resize 224x224 -gravity center -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -extent 224x224 $file; done` then `cd ..` then `cd ..` again then `cd images/dying/ && for file in *; do convert $file -resize 224x224 -gravity center -background "rgb(0,0,0)" -extent 224x224 $file; done` then `cd ..` twice once again  
3a\. Run aug.py to create new images with added noise, random brighnes and cropping `python3 aug.py`  
3b\. (Optional) Copy your old images to augmented as well `cp images/healthy/* augmented/healthy/ && cp images/dying/* augmented/dying/`   
4\. Run generator train.py  
5\. (Optional) Run metrics.py to see which images in the training data your model is failing to classify  
## Predicting
Change the file variable in predict.py to point towards the image you want to check then run it  
If you get the /tmp direcotry doesn't use RAM message you can create a 10MB RAM backed directory called /ram by running the command `sudo mkdir -p /ram && sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=10m tmpfs /ram` and then change [tmp_dir](https://github.com/qwertpi/catvdogcnn/blob/07745d8058cb5fb8e8b346d3023d38c46d80b65d/predict.py#L7) to point to your RAM backed directory eg. tmp_dir="/ram/"  
I have attached 3 images that I believe to be in neither the train nor test set for you to use in prediction testing if you want
